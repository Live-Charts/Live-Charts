Live charts is an easy way to build poweful charts, all charts are animated, they update every time you change your data, it also has an awesome performance. 

 - Good looking, animated and easy to customize charts, you can practically change all properties.
 - Autoupdate UI, you just create a SeriesCollection, then LiveCharts will handle everything.
 - MVVM Charting, Support for WPF Bindings.
 - Easy to maintain and create new charts, as you can see in the source code, some charts have almost no code.
 - Supports zooming and panning.
 - MIT License, permissive licensing.
 
This is the logic you use in every chart, there are just some litle properties or rules that change from each type of chart

```c#
//create a new SeriesCollection
var seriesCollection = new SeriesCollection();

//create some LineSeries if ypu need so
var charlesSeries = new LineSeries
{
  Title = "Charles",
  Values = new ChartValues<double> {10, 5, 7, 5, 7, 8}
};
var jamesSeries = new LineSeries
{
  Title = "James",
  Values = new ChartValues<double> { 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 9 }
};

//add series to seriesCollection
seriesCollection.Add(charlesSeries);
seriesCollection.Add(jamesSeries);

//now just assing this seriesCollectionto your chart
//you can use wpf bindings if you need it
myChart.Series = seriesCollection

//create some labels if necessary
var labels = new string[] {"Jan", "Feb" , "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Ago", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"};
myChart.AxixX.Labels = labels;
```

### About Versions

This library has suffared hard changes and it is in a pre-release state, even we are really close now to a 1.0 version documentations might not match with the latest release, examples in this repo are always up-to-date, the safest version is 0.6.4, the most animated and safe is 0.6.6, 0.7.0 is comming soon, fixing all reported bugs, adding at least 5 more series, and making live charts portable, this means this lbrary will be ready to run in WinForms, Wpf, Uwp and Xamarin.

## Is live charts what you are looking for? see these interesting examples.

* **[Live Data](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/wiki/91-Live-Data)**: a charts that adds new data each second, DateTime as X Axis.
* **[Filter records from a data base](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/wiki/92-Filtered-Data)**: a chart that pulls data from a data base according to a simple user filter.
* **[IObservableChartPoint](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/wiki/93-IObservableChartPoint)**: this chart uses a view model that implements `IObservableChartPoint`, this will update chart every time a desired property changes.
* There are much more examples in this solution, go to examples folder up here ^^^
* High performance charts are almost ready, current test can draw 3 million points in only 1 second

#Supported Platforms

Only WPF and WinForms for now, I am playing with the code to find an easy way to extend it as PCL

# Installation

**1**. Install package from [**Nuget**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LiveCharts) `Install-Package LiveCharts`
