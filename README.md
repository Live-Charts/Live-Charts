### it is also
# Simple, Interactive

As easy as manipulating any generic list in .Net, LiveCharts updates and animates as your data changes in real time, charts are also sensitive to size changes.

### and of course it also is
# Powerful

LiveCharts is not just beauty charts, this example contains 100,000 points, and the chart is being refreshed constantly, we support zooming, panning, multiple axes, sections, merged UIelemnts and much more!

But that is not all, we try to support as many charts as possible, bars, lines, heat maps, gauges, maps:

 - [x] ~~WinForms~~
 - [ ] UWP **[In progress]**
 - [ ] Xamarin
- [ ] Release 1.0 in WPF and WinForms, the other platforms will be beta, in case something went wrong.

### Support

WPF and Winforms, currenlty the library is in the process to become a cross net library...
