${if, {platform} == 'wpf'}

Finally configure LiveCharts according to your needs:

${if, {platform} == 'wpf'}

```c#
Charting.Settings(charting =>
{
    charting
        .ForPrimitiveAndDefaultTypes()
        .UsingWpf()
        .UsingMaterialDesignLightTheme();
});
```

If you need more information about the previous block, please see `docs/getting started/settings`.
